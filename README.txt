ShoeX — Shoe Store (LocalStorage Demo) — v3
===========================================

Update
------
- **Checkout now requires customer details**: First name, Surname, Email, Phone, and Address are mandatory.
- **Validation**: Basic email and phone validation before placing an order.
- **Orders page**: Admin can see customer name, email, phone, and address on each order card.

Quick Start
-----------
1) Unzip the folder.
2) Open `admin-login.html` and create/login as admin (first time only).
3) Add brands and products in the Admin dashboard.
4) Browse `index.html`, add items to cart, go to `checkout.html`.
5) Fill in all required details and click **Place order**.
6) Check **Admin → Orders** to view the saved order with customer details.

Notes
-----
- This is a static demo using `localStorage` (single-browser, not secure). For production, use a backend (e.g., Firebase).
